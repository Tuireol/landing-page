            <p>Homogenic is the third studio album by Icelandic recording artist Björk. It was released on 20 September 1997 by One Little Indian Records. Produced by Björk, Mark Bell, Guy Sigsworth, Howie B, and Markus Dravs, the album marked a stylistic change, focusing on similar-sounding music combining electronic beats and string instruments with songs in tribute to her native country Iceland.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Upon its release, Homogenic received widespread critical acclaim. It topped the Icelandic albums chart, peaking at number 28 on the US Billboard 200 and number 4 on the UK Albums Chart. The album produced five singles—"Jóga", "Bachelorette", "Hunter", "Alarm Call", and "All Is Full of Love"—and was further promoted with the Homogenic Tour (1997–1999). Retrospectively, Homogenic has continued receiving critical acclaim, being listed among the best albums of all time by numerous critics.</p>

            <p>Enjoy Eternal Bliss is the debut EP by English post-rock band Yndi Halda released on the Big Scary Monsters Recording Company in the UK; Burnt Toast Vinyl in the USA and XTAL Records in Japan. It was first made available online on 13 November 2006 before being released in shops in February 2007. The EP was previously self-released as a 3-track demo through the band's website and live performances. This version of the EP did not include the track "A Song For Starlit Beaches".</p>
            <br>
            <p>The title "EP" is often called into question due to the record's length (about 1 hour and 5 minutes). Indeed, only the UK edition of "Enjoy Eternal Bliss" was titled as such - in all other territories it was renamed as an LP or full-length album on behalf of the band.</p>
            <br>
            <p>"Kerrang!" ranked it as one of the 16 greatest post-rock releases of all-time.</p>

            <p>Mass of the Fermenting Dregs (マス オブ ザ ファーメンティング ドレッグス, Masu obu za Fāmentingu Doreggusu), stylized as MASS OF THE FERMENTING DREGS, is a post-hardcore/shoegaze trio formed in Kobe, Japan in 2002. They are also popularly known by a shortened form of their name, Masu Dore (マスドレ). They are known for a tightly arranged, guitar-driven style, melodic pop vocals and a high-energy stage presence at their live events. They have been signed to the Japanese indie rock record label AVOCADO Records since the release of their self-titled EP in January 2008.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The band's sound is often compared to that of other influential Japanese post-hardcore acts, notably NUMBER GIRL (ナンバー・ガール). They are often associated with the alternative/progressive rock act 9mm Parabellum Bullet(キューミリ・パラベラム・バレット), with whom they toured in early 2009. The English version of the band's website also claims western alternative rock bands Sugar, The Wedding Present, and The Smashing Pumpkins as influences on their songwriting.</p>
